Chapter 1.2 Booting the Image
==============================

Now that you have the ISO file, you need to put the image on a media device and boot the image for installation.

**This requires additional research on your own, as this varies depending on your hardware.**

Choosing the media
------------------
In order to boot the image, you need to put it somewhere. You have two choices either

 - a DVD
 - a USB drive (4 GB or greater)

Writing/burning the Image
-------------------------
Here are some common tools to burn images onto DVDs:
 - Windows Disc Image Burner
 - Brasero
 
Windows 7 / 8 / 10 / 11 
-------------------------
 - Right-click on the ISO file you just downloaded and choose ‘Burn disc image’.

- Select a Disc burner (drive) and choose ‘Burn’. If you check ‘Verify disc after burning’, it will confirm that the ISO image has been burned correctly.

Linux
-------------------------
- Install Brasero

.. code::

 sudo apt-get install brasero

- Open Brasero and click on the ‘Burn image’ button.
- Then select the ISO you downloaded in the ‘Select a disc image to write’ box and your DVD drive in the ‘Select a disc to write to’ box and click the ‘Burn’ button.

Making a Denios-OS Bootable USB Drive
-------------------------------------
There are many ways and here we will explain one for beginners:
- Rufus
- Etcher

Windows 7 / 8 / 10 / 11 
-------------------------
Etcher:
 - Plug your USB drive into an available USB port on your Windows PC, note which drive designator (e.g. “G:\”) it uses once it mounts, and launch Etcher.
 - Click Flash from file, and locate the Denios Linux ISO file to be imaged with.
 - Click Select target and choose the USB drive you want to make bootable.
 - Click the Flash! button once ready.

Rufus:
 - Plug your USB drive into an available USB port on your Windows PC, note which drive designator (e.g. “G:\”) it uses once it mounts, and launch Rufus.
 - With Device, check the dropdown list of options for the USB drive (e.g. “G:\” and size).
 - Boot selection needs to point to point to the Denios Linux ISO file, which can be done by clicking the SELECT button
 - Depending on your configuration, you can set the Partition scheme, as well as Target system. If you are not sure, leave it as the default values.
 - Click the START button once ready.

- You may get a prompt saying about ISOHybird image. Selecting ISO image, will allow you to edit the files from the Denios Linux ISO, but at the potential lose of hardware compatibility. As a result, we recommend selecting DD Image.

- Note: If you select “DD Image” option, you can create another partition on the USB drive, allowing you to use the rest of the space. Start -> Run (Windows + R) -> diskmgmt.msc -> Locate the USB drive -> Right-click in “Unallocated” -> New Simple Volume -> Follow the rest of the wizard with next, next, next…

Booting the Image
-----------------
With your media inserted, reboot your computer. Depending on your hardware configuration, it may boot into the image right away, or you might need to press a key at startup for boot options. This varies but looking for documentation for your hardware will likely provide the answer.



**You have now booted the image. Please continue to Chapter 1.3.**
