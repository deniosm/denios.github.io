Chapter 2.1.4 QEMU/LibVirt 
=====================================

We understand there are a lot of options for interfacing with KVM and QEMU to create different VMs, however for the purposes of this guide we will be using the most common option.
To get a Debian based system prepared for this, we can simply run the following command:

.. code::

  sudo apt update && sudo apt install virt-manager -y

. This will pull in all of the necessary packages and will allow us to create our VM just fine.
After virt-manager is installed, we can launch it and put in our password as we need elevated permissions for some tasks.
From here we can select the “+” and begin to create our VM:

.. image:: libvirt-1.png

We want to ensure we select local ISO file:

.. image:: libvirt-2.png

We choose our ISO and also de-select guessing the OS and input “Debian 11”:

.. image:: libvirt-3.png

We make sure to use 2GB of memory and 2 CPU cores:

.. image:: libvirt-4.png

We set our system to be 20GB:

.. image:: libvirt-5.png

We can now finalize setup by changing the system name to “denios-linux”:

.. image:: libvirt-6.png

From here we can follow the normal Denios Linux installation.
