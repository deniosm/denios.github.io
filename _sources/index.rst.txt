D3NIOS GNU/LINUX
----------------

Denios Gnu/Linux offers you the experience of using the OS in a more secure and private way. The system is built entirely from its own, independently developed source forked from the Debian test/unstable branch, with carefully selected features and optimizations to improve system and user stability and security, while offering full customization and a growing collection of packages not found in official debian repositories.
All included software is free and open source, compatible with DFSG and GNU guidelines.
